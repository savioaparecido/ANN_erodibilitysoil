# ANN_erodibilitysoil
ANN developed to predict the erodibility parameters tau_c and K_d


In excel input, this is where you will place the input data. Don't worry, if one of the variables isn't in the model, if you leave it empty or enter any number, it won't take it into account in the model.

Run the two cells in the main tc - user file ... remember in the first line of the second cell to choose which model you want to use... finally, don't change the rest of the code, as it will give an error. It will return an output file with the tc values.

The same applies to Kd
